## Nexus Workshop 2020 @ Prisma Day

This repository contains a very basic starter that will help you get up and running quicker for the workshop.

The steps that we will follow during the workshop can be found here [nxs.li/learn/tutorial](http://nxs.li/learn/tutorial).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/graphql-nexus/workshop.git
```

2. Install the dependencies

```sh
cd workshop && npm install
```

3. Start the GraphQL server

You should be prompted with a warning telling you that "[...] Your GraphQL schema is empty.".
This is all fine and expected, we'll start building that schema during the workshop!

```sh
npm run dev
```

4. Open the playground

If the server started properly, you should see the following log:

```
‚óè nexus:server listening  --  url: 'http://localhost:4000/'
```

Click that url (http://localhost:4000), it should open the GraphQL Playground.

5. You're all set!
